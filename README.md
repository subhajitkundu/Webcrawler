# Webcrawler

Crawl.sh shell script has been written which take urls as input like (https://www.cyberciti.biz) and crawl the domain and made a list ina file Crawl.txt at the script execution location

you need to run the script as ./Crawl.sh and it will ask to enter url. you can put https://www.cyberciti.biz , it will create a file also display the file content on execution window.

I have tested for thw bwlow urls and it is working fine:

https://www.cricbuzz.com
https://www.cyberciti.biz
